## Getting Started
Can download this code with any method and over the terminal with the commands:

- git clone https://github.com/jose-Abel/re-former.git

Following theodinproject.com guidelines, this project has 2 routes:

- /users/new
- /users/:id/edit

So in order to test it, once the project is cloned, and the server running typing in the terminal from the root of the project the following command:

rails server

Go in the Browser to the localhost:3000 and add the endpoint /users/new to create a new user. 

Once a new user is created can go to the 2nd endpoint /users/:id/edit (in this case :id will be 1 since is the first user created) and can edit your previous created user.
